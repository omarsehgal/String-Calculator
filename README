simple implementation of the string calculator method
to run, download the ruby file, make it executable, and simply run it
it runs the following five scenarios:

1. Create a simple String calculator with a method Add(numbers) that takes a string
--The method can take 0, 1 or 2 numbers, and will return their sum (for an empty string it will return 0) for example “” or “1” or “1,2”
--Start with the simplest test case of an empty string and move to 1 and two numbers

2. Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers

3. Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
--the following input is ok: “1\n2,3” (will equal 6)
--the following input is NOT ok: “1,\n”
--Make sure you only test for correct inputs. there is no need to test for invalid inputs

4. Allow the Add method to handle a different delimiter:
--to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ .
--the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported

5. Calling Add with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not allowed” – and the negative that was passed.if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message
